# Blue-Axolotl-Detector-1.20.X

This is the Official Page for the Blue Axolotl Detector Mod. This mod was made in collaboration with iiqv at https://github.com/iiqv.
This mod is our first Minecraft mod that we've worked on and it is currently in development.

# About

The mod is a simple mod that adds a /bad (blue axolotl detector) command into the game that scans for any blue axolotl's around the player and will send a private message to the player if it detects a blue axolotl.
The mod currently only works client side meaning that it only works on a single player world the user has made themselves.
